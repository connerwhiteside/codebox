-BlockFinderPlugin

This project is onging and is not intended for others to use at this moment,
although, from a development standpoint, clone away!

I am not a professional and know there are other solutions out there for this
sort of thing; I just wanted to see if I could build something similar!

Description:
The BlockFinderPlugin is a plugin for Minecraft that, when enabled, will check
the surrounding blocks of a player for a specified block type.
